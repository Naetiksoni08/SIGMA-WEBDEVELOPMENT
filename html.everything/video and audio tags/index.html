<!-- autoplays plays the video automatically  -->
 <!-- attributes of vdeio tag are src,loop,autoplay,controls,muted it used to mute the video,poster sttribut acts like a thumbnail to a video like this one and the last tag is width and height-->
  <!-- now when it comes to audio tag we have src autoplay controls loop,muted ,preload the audio-->

  <!-- next is svg we can create images through svg it comes under image and media -->
   <!-- also note video audio and media are inline elements that is why it comes in single line -->
    <!-- now what we have done is we have made a new file with img.svg and we have wrriten its code inside the svg file and we called that svg inside the index.html but it didnot get printed this is because whenever we want to use a svg file inside our webpage we have to use namespace extension declaration and thats is  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" -->
     <!-- now we can also embbed a website in our website using i frame -->
      <!-- we can also embed a youtube video in our webpage like go a youtube vdeio open that video click on share and u will geta  option of embed click on embed and copy the code and paste it inside your html document  -->

<!-- id refers to unique indentifiers -->
<!-- where as classes name can be given to multiple tags like div and anchor etc -->
<!-- each person has his or he unique id so id cannot be same of two person in any case whereas we can give same class name to two or more person -->
<!-- id should be started with # in css and class should be started with . -->
<!-- id and classes are nothing but they are attributes only -->
<!-- they are elements ke attributes -->
